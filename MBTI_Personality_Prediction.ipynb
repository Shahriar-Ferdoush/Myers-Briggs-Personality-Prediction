expectation that you should live up to their expectations which is infuriating in and of itself probablyits just because hitting a women is politically incorrect and some women will use that to their advantagewhat hes saying is that they should assume that if they say something worthy of being hit for that they should be grateful when theyre not hit for it not expect not to be hit just on the

         \"i said zero flexibility and little time for dating going around sifting through dates to find one that clicks isnt going to be as viable  that has nothing to do with maintaining a

looking to get into a relationship because youre about to enter a life phase where you will not have any resources to give to a relationship   that isi do take it slow thats why im still single but im not interested in making friends i  have friends enough for my liking im interested in going on dates with the intent of entering aabsolutely not for me i find the idea repugnant actuallypeople could have been polite maybe average is a more conservative bet and im not claiming im a social butterfly im just a normal guy who is introverted but not a social doofus  i dontim probably giving up the online thing here when my next subscription runs out after that i really dont know where to look bars are a definite no i dont understand where people meet theirive tried both ways actually the last few women i have gone out with have gotten really weird andor ignored my backhanded compliments i dont know what to do anymore seems i get screwed eitherim actually pretty healthy     sorry you feel that way not sure which ones you met but assholes exist everywhere the number isnt anywhere near 99 thoughif anything i err on the side of being indifferent definitely not overeageryeah my close friends dont live near me anymore  the issue is that i have been meeting people a good amount and nothing works i want to know why it is that deformed infirm mentally unstablemy friends are in worse positions than i am asking them isnt going to help   as far as feedback not really because that seems like an extraordinarily awkward thing to ask someone you barelyso im a 26 year old male who has been striking out time and time again when it comes to relationships ive been in one relationship my entire life that lasted like 15 years and ended when i wasi dont think this sort of dating method is very reasonable and at best it is counterproductive being friends first just throws a wrench in what is normally a smooth dating process when you fearnever was a kissi appreciate the feedback i think im just going to tell her we shouldnt hang out unless she can dedicate a decent amount of time to it what is happening right now is dragging things out andi dont know after thinking more im on the verge of giving up it has nothing to do with seeing her infrequently or not making it official or what have you its that she keeps thingsi dont know im not a model or anything but im decent looking shes drop dead gorgeous and nice and smart guys are always after her it seems but im also smarter and have better careeri like your answer but maybe im just being optimistic it is basically what ive been doing i cant shake the feeling that she wouldnt be giving me any of her time if she werent interested andhow am i supposed to know if an infj just wants to be friends things have been very weird with an infj ive been seeing ive been very upfront about my intentions and she essentially told me sheinteresting i find it unusual infjs are known for taking forever to open up and trust people yet all the responses so far have indicated kissing in 3 or fewer datesmy infj friend has been with an intj and i dont want to bust your confidence but even though she liked him at first she soon found out that he was putting her down and felt caged i can see thatenlighten us infjs also indicate your gender and if you initiatedwell there was more than that she also said she was basically trying to figure out if im trustworthy and decentthose two things seem at odds how can you be simultaneously not saying things that need to be said but also being proactively aggressivepretty much yeah women just do not enjoy my company on any level im in the same situation never had any female friends dated one person in my life and it lasted a little less than two years thei dont think that is going to help me dig myself out of the very clingy seeming hole i dug myself i basically asked her if she knew i was romantically interested and she responded of course loli should have just let things proceed at a natural pace pretty pissed at myself about zero chance she speaks to me againi read through most of that thread from what i can tell i never did anything egregious good chance she lost interest after my bluntness though loli broke that off shortly after my post i felt like a slime ball i only did it because people were telling me shes a lost cause and i should see other people btw i have a very well developedupdate on this told her i liked her and got no reassurance she liked me or even that she wasnt interested those who said she was ambivalent were right im pretty much calling it off at this pointyeah so i told her and didnt get an affirmation she liked me nor that she didnt she basically said she had known for a while i like her pretty much what i expected probably going to call itis the crystal ball reference supposed to mean your guess is as good as mine or what edit guess not pso ive gone on six or so dates with an infj over a 3 month period shes pretty busy and me too and recently i feel like progress has been a little glacial for a bit i thought she was warming upshe hates texting  and yeah she told me how picky she was about people recently and that normally she wouldnt give anyone the time of dayyou would literally have to have an autism spectrum disorder i would know  not to mention you dont tell someone who is just friends how much you like them that would be more than bizarreits kind of hard to get to the point of officially dating when you have no idea what is going on in her head for all i know an attempt to kiss her would result in abject horror and assaultspoke to her last night she essentially said she likes me a lot and would normally never make any time for people unless she was obligated to but she also indirectly used the word friend but itso i met an infj female a while back and weve been out like five or so times on a date they go well we get along everything seems nice i find her very attractive and we have quite a bit in  i dont know i kind of have a rule that i dont compliment a female on her appearance until she trusts me i did compliment her personality a few times  she is extremely cautious from what iwell now i have a new question went on a second date a few days ago and it went well and she said she wanted to meet up again the problem is there hasnt been an ounce of flirting or touchingshe started initiating with me and asked if im free soon _    if there is anything to be learned it is dont play the analysis game you will loseexpectations ofi dont know i cant really fault a strong introvert

and the political institution for catholicism their teachings of christ are said to be protected bypriests were relocated to other parishes so they may quiet down the criticism of the time and handle
